# EVENT-PROMOTER-APP


### ABSTRACT

Events play an important role in our society. Any happening or an activity can be referred as an event. Individuals often find they lack the expertise and time to plan events themselves. Independent planners are needed to step in and give these special events the attention they deserve. In the current scenario, planning an event requires a lot of patience and hustle bustle right from deciding the theme to deciding venue and events. Lots of factors need to be considered while making each decision.

This project intent to solve the problems of propagating news and information, and also alleviate the problem of traditional event managing procedures such as lots of paper work, or long queue at the registration desk. The objective of this project is to develop an android application which provides interesting news and events. Moreover, users will be able to manage their event participation, such as reserving their seats in events, registering at the event site, and so on.

### INTRODUCTION

This application focuses on solving problems of event registration and management and also providing news, information of events, and project ideas. First of all, users will be able to reserve and manage their event participation via this application. Additionally, this application provides significant information and news of many interesting events from the event provider.
This application system consists of two main components which are front-end system and back-end system.

• The Front-end System is the information-displaying section which queries the data from the remote database and also able to send data to be stored in the database. Moreover, the staff side front-end system will send the participant information to the server to verify their identity.

• The Back-end System is the database management section which always interacts with the front-end system. Additionally, it will send the required data to the front-end system whenever the request is sent.

Event scheduling is a fest management system shaped to provide all the necessary manipulations and maintenance of data related to fest conducted by the different departments of various colleges. It includes the management of coordinators and volunteers who manage the event, sponsors who provide the basic funding to the fest and the participants. The main objective of the scheduling is to avoid the overlapping of venues and time for each event. This is done by Genetic Algorithm usage. The budgeting, account of expenses and managing it is also a tedious job in event scheduling.
